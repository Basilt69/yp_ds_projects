This repository containes my projects created during "Data Science Specialist" training program by Yandex Praktikum.Should any of my projects display incorrectly, please open it with Google Colab link attached to the project. 

|â„–|Title|Description|Libraries|
|---|-----------|---------------------|----------|
|00|[Music preferences](00_musical_preferences.ipynb)| Yandex.Music is a large product with a huge amount of data for research. The mode of listening by residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg is analyzed. Investigated the difference between music played on the way to work on Monday morning versus music played on Wednesday or at the end of the work week.|pandas|
|01|[Data preprocessing](01_reliability_of_borrowers.ipynb)|The customer is the bank's credit department. It is required to determine whether family status and number of children of a client influence the fact of the due loan repayment. Input data is the bank statistics on clients' solvency. The results of our analysis shall be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to the bank |pandas, seaborn, pymystem3|
|02|[Exploratory data analysis](02_real_estate_predictions.ipynb)| The task of this project is on the basis of the data of the service Yandex.Apartments for sale in Saint-Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years to learn how to determine the market value of the real estate. We shall set parameters which can be used for an automated system tracking anomalies and fraudulent activity|pandas, matplotlib, numpy|
|03|Statystical data analysis|The main task of this project is to define on the basis of the federal mobile operator data which tariff plan brings more money to the company|scipy, numpy|
|04|Intermediate project - 1|As part of the online store "Streamchik" team, which sells computer games around the world, your task is to identify patterns that determine the success of the game on the basis of historical data on game sales, user and expert evaluations, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation). This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns|pandas, seaborn|
|05|Introduction to machine learning|Tha main aim of the project is to create a modelto predict tariff for mobile operator client|scikit-learn,joblib|
|06|Supervised learning|The task of this project is on the basis of historical data to predict whether a client termines the contract with the bank and leaves it|sckit-learn, matplotlib|
|07|Machine learning in business|As part of the GlavRosGosNeft production company you need to decide which region fits for new drills. ML model shall help to identify the region with the hishest potential profit|scikit-learn,matplotlib|
|08|Intermediate project - 2| Modeling of the recovery rate of gold from gold ore to help to optimize production not to run a plant with loss-making characteristics| scikit-learn, seaborn|
|09|Linear algebra|The task is to protect customer data from "We're not afraid of the flood" insurance company developing a method to convert data so that it would be difficult to recover personal information|numpy, sciit-learn|
|10|Numerical analysis|Predictiong of the cars market price using gradient boosting|lightgbm, sklearn|
|11|Time series|Predictiong of the next hour taxi orders' number|statsmodels, lightgbm|
|12|[Comments classifier](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Basilt69/yp_ds_projects/blob/main/12_toxic_comments_project.ipynb)|Wikishop online store launches a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, as in wiki communities. That is, clients offer their edits and comment on the changes of others. The store needs a tool that will search for toxic comments and send them for moderation|spacy,pandas, numpy, nltk, matplotlib,Catboost, LogisticRegression, SGDClassifier|
